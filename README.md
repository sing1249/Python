# 🐍 Python Projects Repository 🎉  

Welcome to my **Python Projects Repository**! 🚀  
This repository showcases the projects I have completed as part of my journey to master Python. These projects are based on exercises and concepts from the **[100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)** course by Dr. Angela Yu.

## 🛠️ **What You'll Find Here**  
- **Hands-On Python Projects**: Each project demonstrates practical implementation of Python concepts.  
- **Self-Coded Solutions**: All the code in this repository is written **by me**! While I watched video tutorials to understand concepts, I avoided simply copying solutions and worked through the challenges on my own.

## 📚 **Learning Journey**  
This repository reflects my progress through the course and my understanding of Python fundamentals, including:  
- 🐍 **Data Types and Variables**  
- 🌀 **Loops and Conditional Statements**  
- 📊 **Data Structures (Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples)**  
- 🔧 **Functions and Modules**  
- 🕹️ **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**  
- 🎨 **GUI with Tkinter**  
- 🌐 **APIs and Web Scraping**  
- 🧮 **CSV Data Handling**  
- 📊 **Data Analysis with Pandas**  
- 🕵️‍♂️ **Web Automation with Selenium**  
- 🛡️ **Error and Exception Handling**
- ⚙️ **Flask**
- 🎨 **Jinja**

## 🌟 **Highlights**  
- **Originality**: Every solution represents my independent thought process and problem-solving skills.  
- **Adaptability**: I often customized the base problems to experiment with additional features and enhance functionality.  
- **Dedication**: Despite having access to provided solutions, I challenged myself to work on every project independently.
