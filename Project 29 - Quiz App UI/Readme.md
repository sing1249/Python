# Quiz App (Tkinter Version)

This project is an updated version of the **Quiz Project** I previously created. The original project was a simple text-based quiz application developed to strengthen core Python skills. In this enhanced version, the quiz app has been upgraded to include a graphical user interface (GUI) using **Tkinter**, and leverages **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles with the use of classes.

## Features

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**  
  The app now uses Tkinter to provide an interactive, user-friendly interface.
  
- **Class-Based Structure:**  
  The project is designed with classes to improve code organization, scalability, and readability.

- **Enhanced User Experience:**  
  - Users can easily navigate through quiz questions.
  - Dynamic feedback for correct and incorrect answers.
  - Simple and intuitive design.
